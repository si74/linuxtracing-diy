Just trying to learn about linux tracing tools

## Purpose

I want to write a very simple socket server or layer 7 http server and a testing cli tool or client and debug/trace using a few different tools:

1. Go profiling
2. Linux tracing tools (which arguably I barely know anything about)

Just going to jot down more notes here as I go along!
